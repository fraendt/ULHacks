# Daily Dose of Discord

This is a discord bot that, when invited to a server, will send cool hobbies to try out daily to inspire people to take up some new hobbies and learn new things.

### Setting up the bot
1. Invite the bot using this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=875933096464248842&permissions=182272&scope=bot
2. Once the bot has joined the server of choice, use the command ```!anchor``` in a channel to have the bot send messages to that channel.
3. Use ```!settime {HH:MM}``` to set the time at which the bot will post daily (UTC).
